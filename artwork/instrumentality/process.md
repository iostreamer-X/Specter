# Meaning

This is to be a reflection of the connections we humans form. Some embrace them and with some
it takes time. 
But if you were to see it, see billions of people embracing and rejecting, it would be nothing short of poetry.

# Ontology

This art comprises of us, people, with a dot as our representation. And each dot has an AT Field or a barrier.

Out of all the dots, two are selected to be start and end, Adam and Lilith.

And when all this is setup, the dance begins.

# Dance

We start with Adam, and seek out the nearest dot. A spiral curve is drawn, with Adam as origin
and the radius is increased till we are near the dot, and then based the AT field of the dot, the curve surrounds the dot. This iteration is done till we reach Lilith.
